# Bipedal-Robot
A 6-DOF bipedal robot with hip, knee, and ankle servos controlled via Arduino. Using inverse kinematics, it calculates joint angles for stable, human-like walking. The design emphasizes gait synchronization, balance, and efficient power management, providing a foundation for advanced humanoid locomotion research.
